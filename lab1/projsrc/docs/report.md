# 1. Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project is to develop a digital infrastructure to serve as the basis for information exchange through a serial port. This infrastructure is divided into two layers - the application layer and the data link layer - and each of these operate independently of each other. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report will serve as a written specification of what was achieved in this development process.
